# U.S. Pollution Analysis (2006â€“2010) â€“ Power BI Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Problem
Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges, affecting both health and climate.  
The U.S. Pollution dataset (2006â€“2010) records daily values of four major pollutants:
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Ozone (O3)
- Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

The raw dataset was large, complex, and not immediately insightful.  
The challenge was: **How do we transform this raw data into an interactive and meaningful analysis?**

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
I designed an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** that converts the dataset into a structured analysis with clear insights:
- **Page 1 â€“ Overview**  
  - Pollution categories with page navigation buttons  
  - Slicers for State, City, County  
  - Filled U.S. map showing pollutants by state  
  - Quarter-wise pollutant bifurcation  

- **Page 2â€“5 â€“ Detailed Analysis (CO, O3, SO2, NO2)**  
  - Top 10 states by pollutant concentration  
  - KPI Cards (Max Hour, Max Value, Units)  
  - Line charts for pollutant trends (2006â€“2010)  
  - Highlighted tables with conditional formatting (highest in red, lowest in green)  
  - Sync slicers for interactive filtering across pages

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **CO & O3** were highest in border cities like *Mexicali*.  
- **Oklahoma** recorded alarming peaks for **SO2 and NO2**.  
- Yearly analysis showed fluctuating but persistent pollution levels across 2006â€“2010.

## ðŸš€ Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- Data cleaning (null values â†’ 0)  
- Interactive visuals (Maps, Slicers, Line/Bar Charts, KPI Cards)
