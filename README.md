# U.S. Pollution Analysis (2006â€“2010) â€“ Power BI Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Problem
Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges, affecting both health and climate.  
The U.S. Pollution dataset (2006â€“2010) contained thousands of rows of data across four pollutants:
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Ozone (O3)
- Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

The dataset was large and complex, making it difficult to understand at first glance.  
The challenge: **How can we transform this raw dataset into clear, interactive insights?**

## ðŸ’¡ Solution & Features
I built a multi-page **Power BI Dashboard** with the following features:

- **Interactive Overview Page**  
  - Slicers for State, City, County  
  - Filled map of U.S. states showing pollutant spread  
  - Quarter-wise bifurcation of pollutants  
  - **Page Navigation buttons** â†’ Overview links directly to pollutant-specific pages (CO, O3, SO2, NO2)

- **Pollutant-Specific Pages (CO, O3, SO2, NO2)**  
  - KPI Cards showing 1st max hour, max value, and pollutant units  
  - Top 10 states with highest pollutants  
  - Tables with conditional formatting (highest = red, lowest = green)  
  - Line charts showing AQI trends from 2006â€“2010  
  - Highlighting the city with the highest pollutant levels  

- **Sync Slicers**  
  - Date-based filtering across all pollutant pages  
  - Makes comparison easier between states and time periods

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Mexicali** recorded the highest CO and O3 levels.  
- **Oklahoma** showed alarming spikes for SO2 and NO2.  
- Seasonal and yearly trends revealed persistent pollution levels across states between 2006â€“2010.
